## Section 1 - Course Intro and DDocker Setup

### Lecture 5 - Docker Editions: Which Do I Use?

* there are 12+ editions
* there is Docker CE (community edition) and EE (enterprise edition)
* stable, edge releases
* docker is no longer one-click installation
* containers change fast. version matters, stay to latest version stick with it
* there are 3 major types of install: Direct, Mac/Win, Cloud
	* direct: you install it on a os and kernel and it runs (native support), linux, raspberry, windows srv 2016
	* win/mac: suite of tools, gui to make linux containers or win containers. mac does not support it natively. in Mac and Win10 a VM is started to run containers
	* cloud: AWS. Google Cloud, MS Azure. usually docker on linux and vendor specific features. AWS=>cloud formation temple, persistent storage, elastic load balancers
* All options support full lifecycle of docker options
* EE = support + Extra products for large organizations (LDAP authentication multiserver gui)
* go for stable (1 every 3month) 4month support

### Lecture 6 - Installing Docker the Fast Way

* for linux: Donot use the build in default packages apt install docker.io
* use the docker automated script to add their repo and add dependencies `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh` [ubuntu setup](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-server-ubuntu)
* for windows server (development env? docker for win) (production? docker container) . LInux VM docker on it

### Lecture 11 - Docker for Linux Setup and Tips

* install on linux locally, on a linux server in cloud or in a linux vm
* the easiest way to get started on docker. 
* was made for linux (why?!?)
* there is no emulation, or vm, it runs straight on the operating system
